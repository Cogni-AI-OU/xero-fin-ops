# Repository Instructions

This folder centralizes editing guidelines enforced by pre-commit and CI. Refer to each file for scope and rules.

Run `pre-commit run --all-files` from the repo root to validate locally.

For guidance on configuring repository instructions, see GitHub's official documentation: [Configure repository instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions?tool=vscode)
