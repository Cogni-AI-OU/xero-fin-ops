# Prompt Catalog for Agents

Authoritative list of prompts in this directory. Use these entries for loading prompts in workflows or
agent sessions, and keep the catalog in sync with files on disk.

For a human-readable overview, see [README.md](README.md).

## Prompts

| Prompt | Format | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| [repository-setup.prompt.md](repository-setup.prompt.md) | Markdown | Full repository setup checklist using org standards from Cogni-AI-OU/.github |

## Notes

- Use Markdown prompts for human-readable checklists and structured guidance.
- Use YAML prompts for GitHub Models or programmatic consumption.
- Update this catalog whenever prompts are added, removed, or renamed.

## Usage

- Keep prompts in sync with this catalog when creating or removing files.
