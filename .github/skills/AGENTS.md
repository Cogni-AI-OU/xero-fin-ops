# Agent Skills Catalog

Authoritative list of skills for agent loading. Each entry points to a `SKILL.md` with activation
criteria and instructions.

For a human-readable overview, see [README.md](README.md).

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [git](git/SKILL.md) | Guide for using git with non-interactive, safe operations |
| [github-actions](github-actions/SKILL.md) | Diagnosing and debugging failing GitHub Actions workflows |
| [pre-commit](pre-commit/SKILL.md) | Guide for using pre-commit hooks to validate code formatting, linting, and security checks |
| [skill-writer](skill-writer/SKILL.md) | Generate or update SKILL.md files for GitHub Copilot coding agents |

## Usage
