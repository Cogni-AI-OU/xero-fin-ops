# CLAUDE.md

This file provides Claude Code-specific guidance. For general agent instructions,
see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Claude Code Configuration

Claude Code is configured via GitHub Actions workflows in this repository.
The primary workflow is [.github/workflows/claude.yml](.github/workflows/claude.yml).

### Triggering Claude

Claude can be triggered by mentioning `@claude` in:

- **PR comments**: Comment on a pull request with `@claude` followed by instructions
- **Inline review comments**: Add `@claude` to a review comment on specific code lines
- **Issue comments**: Comment on an issue with `@claude` followed by instructions
- **New issues**: Create an issue with `@claude` in the title or body
- **Reply to Claude's comments**: Reply to Claude's comments (posted via
  `github-actions[bot]` with claude-code-action markers) to continue the
  conversation without needing to mention `@claude` again

**Who can trigger Claude:**

- Organization owners, members, and collaborators (on any PR/issue)
- PR authors (on their own PRs only)
- Issue authors (on their own issues only)

**Security**: External contributors cannot trigger Claude on other people's PRs or
issues. This prevents unauthorized API usage and ensures code changes are reviewed
by trusted users.

**Note**: Claude's comments appear under the `github-actions[bot]` user because
they are posted through the GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow identifies
Claude's comments specifically by looking for the `claude-code-action` marker
to avoid confusion with other workflows that also post as `github-actions[bot]`.
This is a limitation of the `anthropics/claude-code-action` and cannot be changed
to display as `claude[bot]` at the workflow configuration level.

### Environment Variables

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: API key for Claude (stored as repository secret)
- `ALLOWED_TOOLS`: Comma-separated list of tools Claude can use

### Model Selection

By default, workflows use `claude-opus-4-5`. To change the model, update the
`model` input in the workflow configuration.

## Tools

Claude Code provides access to various tools for interacting with the repository
and environment.

### Allowed Tools

The allowed tools are defined in workflow files under the `ALLOWED_TOOLS`
environment variable. Current categories include:

- **Git operations**: `Bash(git:*)` - Full access for commits and pushes
- **GitHub CLI**: `Bash(gh issue:*)`, `Bash(gh pr:*)`, `Bash(gh search:*)`
- **Data processing**: `Bash(jq:*)`, `Bash(yq:*)`
- **Pre-commit**: `Bash(pre-commit run:*)` - Run code quality checks

If you need a tool that isn't in the allowed tools list, suggest adding it to
the relevant workflow file in `.github/workflows/`.

**Note on git access**: You have broad git access to commit and push changes.
The workflow has strict access controls ensuring only trusted users can trigger you.
Repository administrators are responsible for configuring branch protection and
monitoring commit activity.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP servers extend Claude's capabilities with additional tools and integrations.
When MCP is enabled via `--mcp-config-file`, you gain access to:

- GitHub API integrations (issues, PRs, repositories)
- External service integrations
- Custom tool implementations

**Custom MCP Configuration:**

MCP configuration is maintained in a separate config file (`.github/mcp-config.json`)
and referenced in workflow files using the `--mcp-config-file` flag.

For information on configuring custom MCP servers, see the
[Custom Agents documentation](.github/agents/README.md).

## Prompting Best Practices

When working with Claude in this repository:

- Reference `AGENTS.md` for coding standards and common tasks
- Reference `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed project context
- Run `pre-commit run -a` before finalizing changes
- Keep responses concise; avoid restating obvious context
- Focus on actionable issues rather than stylistic preferences

## Xero FinOps Specific Notes

This repository contains Python CLI tools for managing Xero accounting data:

- Scripts use `uv` for dependency management with script headers
- All scripts should be executable and use `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script`
- Handle `BrokenPipeError` for CLI tools that might be piped
- Load credentials from `xero_config.yaml` and `.xero_token.json`
- Always implement `--dry-run` flag for commands that modify data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow not triggering**: The workflow triggers for `@claude` mentions or replies
   to comments from `github-actions[bot]`. Check workflow logs for permission issues.
2. **Tool not allowed**: Check if the tool is in `ALLOWED_TOOLS`; request addition
   via PR if needed.
3. **Linting failures**: Run `pre-commit run -a` locally to identify issues before
   committing.
4. **MCP connection errors**: Verify the MCP server URL and authentication in
   workflow configuration.
